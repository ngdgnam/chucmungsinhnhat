# Zalo Bot (Integrated)

This repository integrates features from Zeid_Bot and GwenDev_ZaloChat.

Features implemented:
- QR login and QR display in terminal and dashboard
- Anti-link and anti-spam
- Auto-down for media links
- Dashboard with logs, commands list, and stats
- `logqr` command: generate a QR code linking to recent logs on the dashboard
- `admin` command: manage bot admins stored in `config.yml`

Termux and VPS support:
- Dashboard binds to 0.0.0.0 so it's accessible from external IPs on VPS
- If running locally or in Termux, use local IP returned by `ip addr` or the `localip` helper
- Scanning the QR generated by `logqr` opens the `/logs` endpoint in the dashboard

Usage:
- Start: `npm run start` or `npm run dev` for development
- Ensure `config.yml` has `dashboard_port` set and, optionally, `dashboard_host`

Contributing:
- We've merged commands and handlers from Zeid_Bot and GwenDev_ZaloChat; duplicates were removed or updated to match the project structure.
